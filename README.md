## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to learn how to know the difference between position:relative and position:absolute;
also learnt how to span a text inside an h1 element 
and lastly i learnt how to stack something over another thing using z-index


```html
<h1>jide<span></span></h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  position: absolute;   positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
  position: relative; positions an element relative to its normal position, 
  z-index:1  The z-index property specifies the stacking order of elements, determining which elements should be in front of or behind other elements. Elements with a higher z-index value will appear in front of elements with a lower z-index value.
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing myself in semantic HTML, CSS and Javascript


### Useful resources
